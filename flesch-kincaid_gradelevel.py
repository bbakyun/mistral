RAG is a system that helps applications, like chatbots, understand and respond to user questions. It has two main parts: data ingestion and text generation. In the data ingestion process, we collect data from various sources, break it down into smaller pieces called chunks, and transform these chunks into embeddings using a large language model. We store these embeddings for later use. In the text generation process, when a user asks a question, the question is transformed into embeddings and similar documents are found. We add the information from these documents to the question to create a more detailed prompt, and then a large language model generates the final response for our application.
This is the process of collecting and preparing data for further use.
Think of embeddings as special representations of data that are easier for machines to understand and process.
A computer program that can generate human-like text based on the data it's given.
Small pieces of data. In this context, data is broken down into chunks to make it easier to process.
This is the user's question plus the information found during the search process. It's used to make the language model's response more accurate and relevant.
A powerful artificial intelligence that can understand and generate human-like text.
A computer program that simulates human conversation. Users can interact with it through text or voice commands.
Amazon Web Services is a platform that provides on-demand access to various IT infrastructure and services, including the embedding and language models used in the RAG system.
