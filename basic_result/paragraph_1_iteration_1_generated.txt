            Here is the original text to explain:
            We are going to talk about some of the data access challenges in We are also going to talk generation or RAG with Amazon Bedrock. We are going to then implement in our RAG application using We are then going to talk about some of the architecture and we are going to finish So what are some of the that we see in our We need to have a robust and once the user is to make sure the user only and not an uncontrolled data access. After that, we also want to make sure our system is scalable. So as we onboard more and it should be able to handle it instead of needing the application to be changed. After that, we also wanna make sure, because we are adding new we don't want to end up with data silos and we should still be able access to our data. And last but not the least, we don't want to impact our existing user experience. All of these stringent security integrate with our And all of that is encapsulated in what we call as data governance.

            Output:
             [/INST] - **Explanation of the Topic**: We're discussing challenges in managing data access using Amazon Bedrock and a tool called RAG. We want to make sure data is secure, accessible only to the right people, and that our system can handle more users and data without needing changes. We also want to avoid creating separate data areas and maintain good user experience. This is all part of a concept called data governance.

- **IT Domain Terms and Definitions**:
  - **Data Access Challenges**: Problems we face when making sure the right people can get to the data they need, while keeping it secure and keeping our system running smoothly.
  - **Data Governance**: A way of managing data to make sure it's secure, accessible, and consistent. It's like having rules for how data is used and making sure everyone follows them.
  - **Amazon Bedrock**: A service that helps manage and secure data access.
  - **RAG application**: A specific tool used with Amazon Bedrock for managing data access.
  - **Scalability**: The ability of a system to handle more users and data without needing changes or becoming slow.
  - **Data Silos**: Separate areas where data is stored that can't be easily accessed or shared with others. It's like having separate boxes for different types of toys, making it hard to play with them all together.
