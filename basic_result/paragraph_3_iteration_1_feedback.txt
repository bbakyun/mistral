### Paragraph 3, Iteration 1 Feedback:

[INST] 
            Please evaluate the following explanation based on the following criteria:
            1. Does it use friendly and everyday language suitable for a 6th grader?
            2. Does it include all IT terms mentioned in the input text, with clear and relatable explanations?

            After evaluating, provide feedback on how the explanation can be improved. Write the feedback in 1-2 sentences.

            - Provide only the feedback without repeating the input text or adding comments.

            ### Explanation to Evaluate:
            [INST] 
            Please read the following text and generate an explanation suitable for a **basic-level audience**. Use **friendly and everyday language** to make the explanation simple and relatable. Ensure that the output is written at a **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 6**. Follow the **exact format provided below**, and avoid including any information outside of this structure.

            ### Explanation Format:
            - **Explanation of the Topic**: 
              Provide a clear summary of the main topic or concept discussed in the input text. Use friendly and conversational language.

            - **IT Domain Terms and Definitions**: 
              Identify IT-related technical terms in the input text and explain each term in a way that's easy to understand. Use analogies or examples from daily life to make the explanation relatable. For example:
                - *"Cloud Computing"*:
                  Imagine storing your favorite photos and videos in a magical online photo album that you can access from any device, anywhere. Thatâ€™s what cloud computing does for your data.

            ### Output Requirements:
            - Write in clear and simple language that a 6th grader could understand.
            - Include only the simplified explanation and term definitions in the output. 
            - Do not include the additional comments, or any unrelated information.
            - Provide only the explanation without repeating the input text or adding comments.

            Here is the original text to explain:
            RAG has two main parts. So first of the parts is the data ingestion workflow. This is where we are for our application. So we have our data sources. As a company, you must have scattered everywhere in So we use that data, we as chunks, and these chunks are then sent to an embedding model, an embedding Large language model, which converts these and stores them in Vector So this is the data ingestion workflow. Now moving on to the next part. We have our text generation workflow. So this is where we have a user using our Chatbot application or and asking questions and So what happens is, the user asks question in natural language, which again gets sent to the embedding model, the question gets and then we do a search So we try to find similar documents. Once we retrieve those similar documents, we augment our prompt with what we retrieved in the search result, and then the augmented prompt is sent to a Large language model, which in turn creates the final response for our application. This is great, but imagine that we see here and the in natural language to embeddings and the whole creation of our for you by an AWS service.

            Output:
             [/INST] - **Explanation of the Topic**: RAG, which stands for data ingestion and text generation, is a system that helps applications understand and respond to user queries. The first part, data ingestion, collects and processes data from various sources. This data is broken down into smaller pieces, called chunks, which are then transformed into embeddings using a large language model. These embeddings are stored for use. The second part, text generation, happens when a user asks a question through an application like a chatbot. The user's question is transformed into embeddings, similar documents are found, and these documents are added to the question to create a more detailed prompt. This prompt is then given to a large language model to generate the final response.

- **IT Domain Terms and Definitions**:
  - **Data ingestion**: This is the process of collecting and preparing data for further use.
  - **Embeddings**: Think of embeddings as special representations of data that are easier for machines to understand and process.
  - **Language model**: A computer program that can generate human-like text based on the data it's given.
  - **Chunks**: Small pieces of data. In this context, data is broken down into chunks to make it easier to process.
  - **Augmented prompt**: This is the user's question plus the information found during the search process. It's used to make the language model's response more accurate and relevant.
  - **Large language model**: A powerful artificial intelligence that can understand and generate human-like text.
  - **AWS service**: Amazon Web Services is a platform that provides on-demand access to various IT infrastructure and services. In this context, it's where the RAG system gets the embedding and language models from.

            Feedback:
             [/INST] The explanation provides a clear and relatable summary of the RAG system and uses friendly language suitable for a 6th grader. The IT domain terms and definitions are explained using everyday analogies and examples, making the concepts easier to understand. However, it might be helpful to provide a brief explanation of what a chatbot is, as it is mentioned in the text, but not defined. Additionally, breaking down the text generation process into simpler steps, like "understanding the question," "finding related documents," and "generating the response," could make it even more accessible to a 6th-grade audience.
